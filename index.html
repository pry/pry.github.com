        <h1>Introductory screencast</h1>
        <p>
          It is recommended you watch the following screencast put
          together by <a href="https://github.com/joshcheek">Joshua
          Cheek</a>. It includes instructions on installing Pry as
          well as some coverage of core features:

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <p>
          Pry is written from scratch to provide a number of advanced features,
          some of these include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Source code browsing (including core C source with the pry-doc gem)</li>
          <li>Navigation around state (cd, ls and friends)</li>
          <li>Rubinius core source browing</li>
          <li>Documentation browsing</li>
          <li>Live help system</li>
          <li>Open methods in editors (edit-method Class#method)</li>
          <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
          <li>Command shell integration (start editors, run git, and rake from within Pry)</li>
          <li>Gist integration</li>
          <li>Runtime invocation (use Pry as a developer console or debugger)</li>
          <li>Exotic object support (BasicObject instances, IClasses, ...)</li>
          <li>A powerful and flexible command system</li>
          <li>Ability to view and replay history</li>
          <li>Many convenience commands inspired by IPython, Smalltalk and other advanced REPLs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Pry also aims to be more than an IRB replacement; it is an attempt to
          bring REPL driven programming to the Ruby language. It is currently not
          as powerful as tools like SLIME for lisp, but that is the general
          direction Pry is heading.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pry is also fairly flexible and allows significant user customization
          making it a good choice for implementing custom shells.
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h1>More examples</h1>

        <h2>Runtime invocation</h2>
        <p>
          Pry can be invoked in the middle of a running program. It opens a Pry
          session at the point it's called and makes all program state at that
          point available. When the session ends the program continues with any
          modifications you made to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          This functionality can be used for such things as: debugging,
          implementing developer consoles and applying hot patches.
        </p>

        {% highlight ruby %}{% include code/runtime.rb %}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
          Pry session:
        </p>

        {% highlight ruby %}{% include code/session.rb %}{% endhighlight %}

        <h2>Command Shell Integration</h2>
        <p>
          A line of input that begins with a '.' will be forwarded to the command
          shell. This enables us to navigate the file system, spawn editors, and
          run git and rake directly from within Pry.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further, we can use the shell-mode command to incorporate the present
          working directory into the Pry prompt and bring file name completion.
          We can also interpolate Ruby code directly into the shell by using the
          normal #{} string interpolation syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the code below we're going to switch to shell-mode and edit the .pryrc
          file in the home directory. We'll then cat its contents and reload the
          file.
        </p>
